# XMLRecipeApp
## Overview
A small Recipe Application where the user will have the option to make one out of a few recipes with the added ingredient list and how to prepare the recipes

## Installation
I used the latest version of Android Studio 2020.3.1 which has updated gradle files. In the case you cloned and couldn't install through Android Studio. Don't worry, I've got you covered.

Go to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle. Here you will see an option to change the JDK version from any of the current JDK version. Click on the current version and go to Download JDK. Here choose Version 11 and the vendor can be anyone. Voila! You've updated and can now run the application.
